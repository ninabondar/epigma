## Epigma
This is a training clone of Figma - an online SVG editor with reduced yet rich functionality.

## Motivation
It first appeared as a training educational project for university course of web development, however now is striving to become something more helpful, still holding the features of an svg editor and remaining a functional style project. 

## Installation
After cloning, run in your console:
 ```yarn install```
 
To start the project, run:
```yarn start```


## Tech stack
#### Frontend: 
 - React Redux
 - Flow typing
#### Backend: 
 - Express
 - MongoDB (via Mongoose)
 
 ## CI
For continious integration Travis CI was chosen, so you can see the status of each build right here on Github.

## Cooperation
At Epigma we stick to KISS and YAGNI paradigm of thinking. This means, we always try to keep config and code as simple as possible and never pre-install something that *might* be useful in the future. Instead, we implement changes step by step when needed.
Please feel free to suggest changes via issues/PRs to make Epigma better.
